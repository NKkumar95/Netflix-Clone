# Features

 2. Modern UI: Stylish interface that replicates the Netflix design.
 3. Content Grid: Displays movies and TV shows in a grid format.
 4. Interactive Elements: Hover effects on content items to enhance user experience.
 5. Signup Page: A basic signup form for new users to "register" (note: this is a front-end simulation and does not include backend functionality).
